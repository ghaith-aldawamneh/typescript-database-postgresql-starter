# About

This project is a base starter kit for making Node.js + Express.js API with TypeScript and [typescript-rest](https://github.com/thiagobustamante/typescript-rest).
It is structured to be fully configured with DB using [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), which is going to be fully usable as a go to Kit to get started with your
next or existing API project.
