This project is a base starter kit for making Node.js + Express.js API with TypeScript and [typescript-rest](https://github.com/thiagobustamante/typescript-rest).
It is structured to be fully configured with DB using [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), which is going to be fully usable as a go to Kit to get started with your
next or existing API project.
## what i learned from this project:
  - a new smart way for importing and exporting the ts modules from the inner files inside the src file.
  - using the ready typescript-rest library that facilitates the responding issue with basic responing messages.
  - Server.buildServices(app) from the server.d.ts.
  - when connection we must handle the connection by, getConnection(), connection.connect().
